## Redirects

If yes, the website use a protection and bots (like GD clients in GDPSes) cannot access to the page.
If no, everyone can access to the page.
If its written "unknown", this is unknown for now (because no one tested).

About JavaScript redirections: it seems that iFastNet-based free hosting services have JavaScript redirections, they are added automatically by iFastNet on every free hosting service that they host to make API/game servers hosting impossible. Paid plans on iFastNet-based services does not have this limitation. Read <a href="https://forum.infinityfree.net/t/i-cant-create-apis-on-infinityfree-and-other-hostings-that-are-powered-by-ifastnet/76039">this InfinityFree thread</a> for more informations.


## Please, help
If you use an host and you discover that the free plan has changed, please login to GitHub, create a new issue that contain the website name, the website URL (the new one if it changed), the new disk space value with the unit (Gb or Mb, warning: Go is not equal to Gb and Gib is not equal to Gb !) and the new bandwith space per month (still with the unit). Ill do every other things, like re-test does the host has JavaScript redirects or not and ill re-rate it if needed. You can also open an issue if an host has changed his name, his url or if it got deleted, open an issue if you have found annother hosting free service, ill be happy to add it ! Thanks for your help !

## How do I bypass JavaScript redirections ?

I've made a little programm that do this !

Its all in Python, so you need Python and PIP (the Python package installer).

Before using it, open a terminal and execte this command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install Js2Py requests
```

To use it, download it in your Python programm folder, then edit your Python programm to add:

```python
import bypassJSredirects
```

To use it, do:

```python
bypassJSredirects.bypassJSredirects('method', 'url', {"headername": "headervalue"}, {"dataname": "datavalue"})
```

It will return a `requests.Response` object, so you can access the response easily.
